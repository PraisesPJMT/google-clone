## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you'll learn how to create a simplified version of the Google search page using HTML and CSS. This project will help you understand basic web page structure, styling, and the use of semantic HTML elements.

## Prerequisites

-   Basic understanding of HTML and CSS
-   A text editor (we recommend Visual Studio Code)
-   A modern web browser

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new directory for your project
2. Open your text editor and create two files in the project directory:
    - `index.html`
    - `styles.css`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view your progress as you work

## Project Structure

Your project should have the following structure:

```
google-clone/
│
├── index.html
└── styles/styles.css
└── images/logo.jpg
```

## HTML Structure

We'll use semantic HTML5 elements to structure our page. Key elements include:

-   `<header>` for the top navigation
-   `<main>` for the central content (logo, search box, and buttons)
-   `<footer>` for the bottom links

## CSS Styling

Our CSS will focus on:

-   Using Flexbox for layout
-   Styling the search box and buttons
-   Creating a responsive design

## Exercises

During the workshop, you'll complete the following exercises:

1. Create the basic HTML structure
2. Add the Google logo (we'll use a placeholder)
3. Create and style the search box
4. Add and style the "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons
5. Implement the header and footer navigation
6. Make the design responsive

Detailed instructions for each exercise will be provided during the workshop.
